# Image-steganography-using-MATLAB
Implemented LSB Algorithm in MATLAB to encrypt and decrypt text information in a cover 
image (greyscale or RGB), retaining the quality of the image and making it imperceptible for human eye. 
Enhanced the standard algorithm by hiding an image, in a cover image and extract it.
Expanded the scope by hiding image or text information in a video file and extract it.
